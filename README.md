# Interactive Form
 An interactive form, with changing elements and validations before submission

 # Special Features
 - added a 'passive' state to all the text fields, in order to keep them from immediately identifying a partially written field as an error, and keeps this behaviour from happening, until the user either leaves the field (blur), or attempts to register (submit), after which it will update after each key-press (keyup);
